<h2><font color="white">My test's and what do they mean???</h2>

<pre>The result's of my test's mean to me that as an individual I'm a well balanced, positive and confident person with an aptitude in the average to above average in most task's. 
A natural ability to resist stress and see issue's as they arise and to also see possible solutions without the need for any stress.
In a team enviroment i can work as both a leader or team member with the ability spot possible oppurtunities and problems that others may not as well as overseeing the teams performance

<h2>My IT Project</h2>
Overview

A simplified and less expensive home automation system that is capable of controling lights, heaters, tv, radios etc by touch, sounds or eye and body motion's for people with disabilities and anyboby who desires a simple solution.
Today these things are availible but are very expensive and require specialists trades like electricians and builders to install or electronic whizzes to build. 
Other devices like Google home or Amazon Alexa can be used but wont connect to or operate all devices and settings correctly requiring multiple diffrent home automation systems.
My project will be an elctronic device operated by a native unit or mobile phone and computer application using eye and body motion, sound or touch to control which can operate all these devices and their functions
and using the power of AI to improve the user experience.

Motivation

I've worked with people who have disabilities for over a decade now and i believe there is a long way to go in bringing home automatation to people with a disability in a inexpensive and easy to operate way.
I have seen the diffuclties caused by this to people with disabilities and their families who cannot afford the expensive home systems or dont have the technical knowledge to operate and add devices and functions to current less espensive units.
This would improve the quality of life and bring more indepenence to those with a disability and their families by creating a simplified way for people to operate their own electronic devices. 

Description











Tools and Technologies:100 Words

Hardware
Raspberry Pi 3 Model B- Linux 
ANAVI Infrared pHAT by Anavi Technology for IR remote control
Pimoroni Speaker pHAT for Raspberry Pi Zero for audio such as device responses or alerts/alarms
ReSpeaker 4-Mic Array for Raspberry Pi for voice control
Raspberry Pi 7" LCD touch screen or bigger for touch control and user experience
1080p HD Camera Module Board 5mp Fish Eye IR Night Vision for Raspberry Pi or more powerful webcam if needed for motion and eye tracking

Software
http://www.pygaze.org/ - eye tracking
http://jasperproject.github.io/documentation/installation/ - voice control
------------------------------------------------------------Motion control
Understanding of Python, Java and C languages for the programmes and the user UX and UI

Skills Required

This project would require mix of building with a Raspberry Pi unit and sensors and possibly abit more of an advanced knowleged of 
programming in languages such as Python, Java or C language to programme each of units and to make sure they a function correctly.
Also experience with building Raspberry Pi would be essential as this is what the unit is mostly comprised of.
As well as having its own native unit unit this system could run on Android and IOS devices so understanding of application making for these device's
The ability to use Raspbian operating system on the Pi to run the desired programmes
A basic understanding of how electronics work would also be desired to prevent any possible injury.

Outcome

The desired outcome for this device is to have the ability to simply control all units that can by controlled by Wifi or Infrared 
by a Rasperry Pi module that can be operated through motion tracking, touchsrcreen, sound or eye tracking.
This device would could be used by anybody and would be especially useful to those with degenerative disabiliies.
Without the need for any complex programming or wiring issues and with a simple user friendly interface that has the ability 
to learn routine's and automatically add new devices and their functionalitiy by AI.
