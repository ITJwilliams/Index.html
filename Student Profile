<h2>My IT Project</h2>

<pre>
<h2><font color="white">My test's and what do they mean???</h2>

<pre>Overview:100 words
A simplified and less expensive home automation system that is capable of controling lights, heaters, tv, radios etc by touch, sounds or motion for people with disabilities.
Today these things are availible but are very expensive and require specialists trades like electricians and builders to install. 
Other devices like Google home or Amazon Alexa can be used but wont connect to or operate all devices settings correctly requiring multiple diffrent home automation systems.
My project will be an elctronic device operated by a mobile app using motion, sound or touch to control which can operate all these devices and their functions.

Motivation:100 words
I've worked with people who have disabilities for over a decade now and i believe there is a long way to go in bringing home automatation to people with a disability in a inexpensive and easy to operate way.
I have seen the diffuclties caused by this to people with disabilities and their families who cannot afford the expensive home systems or dont have the technical knowledge to operate and add devices and functions to current less espensive units.
This would improve the quality of life and bring more indepenents to those with a disability and their families by creating a simplified way for people to operate their electronic devices. 



Description:500 words











Tools and Technologies:100 Words
This project would require a firm understanding of programming languages Python and Java for the creation of the application on mobile phones and websites and also Raspberry Pi module and Arduino to recieve and decode IR data.






Skills Required:100 words




Outcome: 100 words
